# Data Science Exercise
Demonstrate your ability to solve a data science problem based on the information available and by making reasonable assumptions. The output work should exhibit machine learning, feature engineering, statistics, and visualization skills. The use of different types of modeling approaches is encouraged!

# There are two Jupyter Notebook files
1) Problem_1.ipnyb (The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year)
2) Problem_2.ipnyb (Perform a segmentation study on the dataset to display useful information using any visualization library)

Both the files contain sufficient markdowns and comments where applicable.
